# TicTacToe
With this game, I wanted to learn the syntax and features of basic python code. For this reason, I decided to create my own version of the children's game Tic Tac Toe. This game can be played in the console by running the TicTacToe.py file that calls the main() function. It is fairly simple and the instructions are included, but to play, a person selects which symbol they want to use: X or O. After selection, the computer randomly selects who is playing makes a move if it is its turn. Once a turn has been made, the computer checks if someone has won or if the board is full before repeating the turn checking once more.
